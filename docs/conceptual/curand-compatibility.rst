====================
cuRAND compatibility
====================

The following table shows which rocRAND generators produce the exact same sequence as the equivalent NVIDIA CUDA cuRAND generator when using legacy ordering, given the same seed, number of dimensions, and offset.

cuRAND is a closed-source library, which makes achieving compatibility difficult. Even when the same underlying algorithm is used, implementation details can differ; for example, how the initial state is initialized, the order in which threads generate and write output values, and how the seed is interpreted or applied. However, despite these differences, the statistical properties remain equivalent.
