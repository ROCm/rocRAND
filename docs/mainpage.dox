@section overview Overview

The rocRAND project provides functions that generate pseudo-random and quasi-random numbers.

The rocRAND library is implemented in the [HIP](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/index.html)
programming language and optimized for AMD's latest discrete GPUs. It is designed to run on top
of AMD's [ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/), but it also works on CUDA-enabled GPUs.
