# rocRAND

The rocRAND project provides functions that generate pseudo-random and quasi-random numbers.

The rocRAND library is implemented in the [HIP](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP)
programming language and optimised for AMD's latest discrete GPUs. It is designed to run on top
of AMD's Radeon Open Compute [ROCm](https://rocm.github.io/) runtime, but it also works on
CUDA enabled GPUs.

Additionally, the project includes a wrapper library called hipRAND which allows user to easily port
CUDA applications that use cuRAND library to the [HIP](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP)
layer. In [ROCm](https://rocm.github.io/) environment hipRAND uses rocRAND, however in CUDA
environment cuRAND is used instead.

## Supported Random Number Generators

* XORWOW
* MRG32k3a
* Mersenne Twister for Graphic Processors (MTGP32)
* Philox (4x32, 10 rounds)
* Sobol32

## Requirements

* Git
* cmake (3.0.2 or later)
* C++ compiler with C++11 support
* For AMD platforms:
  * [ROCm](https://rocm.github.io/install.html) (1.7 or later)
  * [HIP-clang](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/blob/master/INSTALL.md#hip-clang) compiler, which must be
    set as C++ compiler on ROCm platform.
* For CUDA platforms:
  * [HIP](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP) (hcc is not required)
  * Latest CUDA SDK

Optional:

* [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) (required only for tests; building tests is enabled by default)
  * Use `GTEST_ROOT` to specify GTest location (also see [FindGTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindGTest.html))
  * Note: If GTest is not already installed, it will be automatically downloaded and built
* Fortran compiler (required only for Fortran wrapper)
  * `gfortran` is recommended.
* Python 2.7+ or 3.5+ (required only for Python wrapper)

If some dependencies are missing, cmake script automatically downloads, builds and
installs them. Setting `DEPENDENCIES_FORCE_DOWNLOAD` option `ON` forces script to
not to use system-installed libraries, and to download all dependencies.

## Build and Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocRAND.git

# Go to rocRAND directory, create and go to build directory
cd rocRAND; mkdir build; cd build

# Configure rocRAND, setup options for your system
# Build options: BUILD_TEST (off by default), BUILD_BENCHMARK (off by default), BUILD_SHARED_LIBS (on by default)
#
# ! IMPORTANT !
# Set C++ compiler to HCC or HIP-clang. You can do it by adding 'CXX=<path-to-compiler>'
# before 'cmake' or setting cmake option 'CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER' to path to the compiler.
#
# The python interface do not work with static library.
#
[CXX=hipcc] cmake -DBUILD_BENCHMARK=ON ../. # or cmake-gui ../.

# To configure rocRAND for Nvidia platforms, 'CXX=<path-to-nvcc>', `CXX=nvcc` or omitting the flag
# entirely before 'cmake' is sufficient
[CXX=nvcc] cmake -DBUILD_BENCHMARK=ON ../. # or cmake-gui ../.
# or
cmake -DBUILD_BENCHMARK=ON ../. # or cmake-gui ../.

# Build
# For ROCM-1.6, if a HCC runtime error is caught, consider setting
# HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET=<arch> in front of make as a workaround
make -j4

# Optionally, run tests if they're enabled
ctest --output-on-failure

# Install
[sudo] make install
```

Note: Existing gtest library in the system (especially static gtest libraries built with other compilers)
may cause build failure; if errors are encountered with existing gtest library or other dependencies,
`DEPENDENCIES_FORCE_DOWNLOAD` flag can be passed to cmake, as mentioned before, to help solve the problem.

Note: To disable inline assembly optimisations in rocRAND (for both the host library and
the device functions provided in `rocrand_kernel.h`) set cmake option `ENABLE_INLINE_ASM`
to `OFF`.

## Running Unit Tests

```
# Go to rocRAND build directory
cd rocRAND; cd build

# To run all tests
ctest

# To run unit tests
./test/<unit-test-name>
```

## Running Benchmarks

```
# Go to rocRAND build directory
cd rocRAND; cd build

# To run benchmark for generate functions:
# engine -> all, xorwow, mrg32k3a, mtgp32, philox, sobol32
# distribution -> all, uniform-uint, uniform-float, uniform-double, normal-float, normal-double,
#                 log-normal-float, log-normal-double, poisson
# Further option can be found using --help
./benchmark/benchmark_rocrand_generate --engine <engine> --dis <distribution>

# To run benchmark for device kernel functions:
# engine -> all, xorwow, mrg32k3a, mtgp32, philox, sobol32
# distribution -> all, uniform-uint, uniform-float, uniform-double, normal-float, normal-double,
#                 log-normal-float, log-normal-double, poisson, discrete-poisson, discrete-custom
# further option can be found using --help
./benchmark/benchmark_rocrand_kernel --engine <engine> --dis <distribution>

# To compare against cuRAND (cuRAND must be supported):
./benchmark/benchmark_curand_generate --engine <engine> --dis <distribution>
./benchmark/benchmark_curand_kernel --engine <engine> --dis <distribution>
```

## Running Statistical Tests

```
# Go to rocRAND build directory
cd rocRAND; cd build

# To run Pearson Chi-squared and Anderson-Darling tests, which verify
# that distribution of random number agrees with the requested distribution:
# engine -> all, xorwow, mrg32k3a, mtgp32, philox, sobol32
# distribution -> all, uniform-float, uniform-double, normal-float, normal-double,
#                 log-normal-float, log-normal-double, poisson
./test/stat_test_rocrand_generate --engine <engine> --dis <distribution>
```

## Documentation
The latest rocRAND documentation and API description can be found [here](https://rocrand.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

It can also be build using the following commands
```
# go to rocRAND doc directory
cd rocRAND; cd doc

# run doxygen
doxygen Doxyfile

# open html/index.html

```

## Wrappers

* C++ wrappers for host API of rocRAND and hipRAND are in files [`rocrand.hpp`](./library/include/rocrand.hpp)
and [`hiprand.hpp`](./library/include/hiprand.hpp).
* [Fortran wrappers](./library/src/fortran/).
* [Python wrappers](./python/): [rocRAND](./python/rocrand) and [hipRAND](./python/hiprand).
